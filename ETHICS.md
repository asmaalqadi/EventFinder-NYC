## Purpose of Data Collection
EventFinder-NYC is designed to provide simplified access to event information across New York City from various sources. This enables users to efficiently discover a broad spectrum of events, ranging from large-scale concerts to niche local events.

## Data Sources and robots.txt Compliance
The primary data sources for this project are Ticketmaster and Do NYC. 

- **Do NYC**: The scraping practices followed the guidlines on site's `robots.txt` file, ensuring no access or  data retrieval from disallowed pages.
- **Ticketmaster**: The data is accessed using API keys provided under specific terms of use that restrict the data usage to personal and non-commercial applications.

## Collection Practices
- **Optimized Request Frequency**: We limit the frequency of our requests to reduce the impact on the servers of the data sources.
- **Respect for robots.txt and Legal Permissions**: Our data collection from Do NYC respects the instructions in the `robots.txt` file, and our use of the Ticketmaster API complies with their legal terms.

## Data Handling and Privacy
- **No Personally Identifiable Information**: Our collection focuses solely on publicly available data about events, such as event names, dates, locations, and URLs. No personally identifiable information is collected from the websites.
- **Secure Data Storage**: All data collected is stored securely and used only within the scope of this project.
